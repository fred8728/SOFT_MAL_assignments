# Discrete mathematics and algorithms

## Assignment 1
```
Implement implementations of the Union-find algorithms:
• Quick-union
• Weighted-union
```
### Solution: [UnionFind](https://github.com/fred8728/SOFT_MAL_assignments/tree/master/SOFT_MAL/src/UnionFind)

## Assignment 2
```
Create a program that can: 
• read any textfile (as the above) into an array or List2
• The content should be sanitized:
– All words should be lower case
– No punktuations - strip commas, full stops, etc.

• sort the array using different sorting algorithms:
– Selection Sort
– Insertion Sort
– Heap Sort
– Merge Sort
– Sorting using a Trie

• be extended with other sorting algorithms in the future.
• messure and log the time used for each algorithm as a function of the file size in words.
